The Micro Python board
======================

The Micro Python board (pyboard) is a small microcontroller board
that runs Micro Python (Micro Python is a lean and fast 
implementation of the Python 3 programming language that is 
optimised to run on a microcontroller).  It is based on the 
STM32F405RGT6 MCU and includes USB, a micro SD card slot and an 
accelerometer.

The production board is PYBv10b.  The schematics and pinout can be
found in the root directory of this repository, the PDF files
prefixed with PYBv10b.

Old files exist for PYBv3.  Eagle files and gerbers for PYBv10b
will be available soon.
